			My name is Kristina,18 years old. I was born in Ukraine, Kiev. I moved from my home country to Switzerland at age of 13, so my independent life started much earlier than I was expecting it. Two years ago I moved to London and currently live here. Iâ€™m still in college, studying Psychology as my main subject. Psychology is something that I was always interested in. Studying this subject doesn't feel like an academic subject that I have to learn. It feels more like gaining knowledge from something I really enjoy exploring and feel engaged with. In future I'm planning to work in this area because I believe that psychology is one of the most important aspects of peoples lives. My main goal is to help people to improve their lives and be happy with who they are. Apart from my interest in psychology I have many different hobbies. My main hobby is Youtube. On my youtube channel I share my lifestyle, my experiences and just have fun communicating with my audiences. I also play the guitar, write music and sing. I consider myself as a creative person because most of my free time goes to learning something new and coming up with new ideas for my Youtube channel. I believe that everything that happens in our lives has its own purpose. I'm trying to stay positive throughout my life and strongly believe that all dreams will eventually come true.
